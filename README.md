# linz-positionz-pcf

This contains the Bernese PCF and configuration scripts for running a PositioNZ-PP job.

When PositioNZ-PP processes a job it clones this repository using a specific branch/tag.
By default the tag "pnzpp-prod" is used for processing in the production environment, and
"pnzpp-nonprod" for processing in the nonprod environment.
